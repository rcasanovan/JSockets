# JSockets

JSockets is a library developed in Java that allows management to encapsulate Sockets for network communication. With JSockets it is incredibly easy to develop projects under the client-server model.
 
The library was originally developed by the Engineer Gerardo Barcia to support development projects in the area of Algorithms and Programming III School of Engineering at the Andrés Bello Catholic University (UCAB) in Caracas, Venezuela. From version 2.0 I joined the project and since then I've been keeping and developing new features.

After years working with the library, I decided to release it as an open source project.
