# JSockets

JSockets is a library developed in Java (and NetBeans) that allows management to encapsulate Sockets for network communication. With JSockets it is incredibly easy to develop projects under the client-server model.

The library was originally developed by the Engineer Gerardo Barcia to support development projects in the area of Algorithms and Programming III School of Engineering at the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University (UCAB) in Caracas, Venezuela. From version 2.0 I joined the project and since then I've been keeping and developing new features.

After years working with the library, I decided to release it as an open source project.

The goals of this code are:

* Abstracting Sockets implementation in Java
* Allow people who don't know the implementation of Sockets deploy applications on the client-server model very easily
* Allow programming teachers create more interesting and complex projects without the need for implementing Sockets

## Adding JSockets to your project

### Server

In order to create your JSockets server, you need to follow these steps:

* Add the JSockets library JAR file to you project
* Create a class that implements ServerLogic protocol
* This class must implement the 'executeOperation' method
* In this method, process the Object arg parameter (it depends from the object that you're using to exchange information between client and server)
* Use the byte[] return value from 'executeOperation' method to return anything you want to the client. You can use the UtilFunctions class in JSockets to transform objects if you need it
* On main class, configure a String array with two elements: server listening port and the class that implements the ServerLogic protocol (String[] parameters = {"7687", "controller.ManagementRequest"};)
* Execute 'main' method from JSockets 'Server' class with the String array parameter (Server.main(parameters);)

### Client

In order to create your JSockets client, you need to follow these steps:

* Add the JSockets library JAR file to you project
* Create a SocketClient object. If you want you can use a singleton object
* Configure the object tht you'll transfer to the server (a String, an array, a complex object)
* If you need an answer from the server, execute the method 'executeRequestWithAnswer' sending the object, the server IP and server port
* Process the server answer. You can use the UtilFunctions class in JSockets to transform objects if you need it
