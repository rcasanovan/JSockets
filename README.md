# JSockets

JSockets is a library developed in Java (and NetBeans) that allows management to encapsulate Sockets for network communication. With JSockets it is incredibly easy to develop projects under the client-server model.

The library was originally developed by the Engineer Gerardo Barcia to support development projects in the area of Algorithms and Programming III School of Engineering at the Andr√©s Bello Catholic University (UCAB) in Caracas, Venezuela. From version 2.0 I joined the project and since then I've been keeping and developing new features.

After years working with the library, I decided to release it as an open source project.

The goals of this code are:

* Abstracting Sockets implementation in Java
* Allow people who don't know the implementation of Sockets deploy applications on the client-server model very easily
* Allow programming teachers create more interesting and complex projects without the need for implementing Sockets
